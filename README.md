# Orento

## Problem Statement
The existing vehicle rental market lacks a comprehensive platform that allows individuals to rent out their personal cars, scooters, or bikes for a specific duration. Users seeking to rent vehicles struggle to find reliable and trustworthy options, while vehicle owners do not have an efficient means to monetize their assets. Additionally, concerns regarding insurance coverage for both parties during the rental period remain unresolved. Therefore, there is a need for a mobile application that addresses these challenges and provides a seamless peer-to-peer vehicle rental experience.

## How Orento solves it?
